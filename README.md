# Instructions for running the project
Firstly you should open an IDE.
Use IntelliJ IDE for a better experience.
Search for "Project from version control" in your IDE.
Then clone my assignment i shared the assignment github link.
# You should modify the DBConnect.java file according to your Database Username and Password
And then import the DBFile into your MySQL DataBase. It will automatically create the database and table. I Have already shared the DBFile into the assignment directory you can import it from there.
